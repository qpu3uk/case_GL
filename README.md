 It took three days to complete these tasks, more precisely three nights
1) the installation of ubuntu and its adjustment
2) writing a utility, not exactly the full version, but the main part
3) registration and learning of Githab

I hope this task will bring me closer to the beginning of my career in a company such as Globallogic
